                               <p><b>Definition of a Pathways school:</b> a school with the Pathways business model in place that includes a success coach developing solutions with the clients to better manage their lives.</p>



                               <p><b>Definition of a Community School:</b> a component of the DHS Pathways to Potential model that is developed based on the needs of the school and the community and is open beyond the traditional school day. Ideally it is open for services 12 hours per day and seven days per week.<br></p>


              A Community School is both a place and a set of partnerships involving the school and other community resources that offer consolidated services provided by multiple agencies in one location with extended hours. The Community School includes not only a DHS success coach that addresses basic needs such as food, Medicaid, child care and emergency needs, but also a full-time Community School coordinator that helps connect families within the school and surrounding community with services.<br><br>

              These services could include support from the faith-based community, area businesses and other organizations stepping in to assist with school supplies, uniforms/clothing (socks, shoes, coats, underwear), tutoring and parenting programs. The additional partners in the school would include but are not limited to: health clinics; mental health organizations; employment agencies that offer training in job skills, resume writing and entrepreneurship; and educational organizations that offer classes or programs such as GED, literacy, English as a Second Language, financial planning, tutoring, mentoring, parenting, housing solutions, and afterschool enrichment.
